# Tutorials for using the PROMICE Sentinel-1 ice velocity dataset

Jupyter Notebook tutorials can be found here to provide an introduction to:
- Downloading from GEUS Dataverse
- Loading and data handling
- Dataset querying
- Plotting and visualisation
- Time-series analysis

## Getting started

To ensure that you have a Python environment configured, we have provided a conda environment file that contains all of the dependencies needed to run the tutorials. A conda environment can be created from this file like so:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
